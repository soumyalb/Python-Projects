Python Projects:

This repository contains several Python projects I completed during my Python training at Future Connect Training.
Each project helped me practice programming logic, problem-solving, and the use of Python libraries.

Projects:
🎮 Rock–Paper–Scissors Game – implemented game logic using loops and conditionals
🔍 Binary Search Program – implemented a quick search function in Python

🗂️ Bulk File Renamer – automated file handling using the OSmodule
🌐 Web Scraping – extracted and processed web data using requests and BeautifulSoup
♈ Zodiac Sign Finder – built an interactive program using user input and date logic.
